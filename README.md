# ❌ X Clone UI – Tailwind CSS Practice Project

This is a **UI-only clone** of the X (formerly Twitter) homepage, created to apply and reinforce my learning of **Tailwind CSS**, **Vite**, and modern frontend development practices using **Node.js tooling**.

---

## 📚 What I Learned

While building this project, I focused on:

- ✅ Setting up a project from scratch using `npm init -y`
- ✅ Installing and configuring **Tailwind CSS** using CLI tools
- ✅ Using **PostCSS** and **Autoprefixer** for compatibility
- ✅ Creating custom build scripts using `package.json`
- ✅ Using `@tailwindcss/cli` to watch and generate CSS (`input.css` → `output.css`)
- ✅ Enhancing workflow with **Vite** for live-reloading during development
- ✅ Applying Tailwind utility classes to build a responsive and modern UI
